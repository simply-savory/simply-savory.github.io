## The Problem 

Many college students have limited kitchen resources, limited cooking skills, limited time, limited access to grocery stores, and no access to creative recipes that respect these constraints. As a result, college students spend money to eat out, or eat non-healthy foods at fast food places or through vending machines.

## The Solution

Simply Savory is a recipe sharing solution that creates a way for students (both on and off campus) to learn and share recipes that:
<ul>
 <li>Can be made using minimal kitchen facilities (at a minimum, a toaster oven). </li>
 <li>Can be made out of ingredients that are available within walking distance of UH. </li>
 <li>Suit local taste sensibilities. </li>
 <li>Can be filtered via dietary restrictions (gluten-free, vegan, etc). </li>
 <li>Have an estimated cost per serving. </li>
 <li>Has an estimated number of servings per recipe. </li>
 <li>Has an estimate of how long it takes to make. </li>
 </ul>
